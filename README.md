# Compression Artifacts Removal based on Frequency Domain Mixture of Experts

---

> **Abstract:** *In recent years, lossy compression standards such as H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC have been proposed and widely applied in image and video encoding. However, these compression algorithms inevitably introduce various complex types of compression artifacts, which severely degrade image quality. Although existing methods have attempted to remove artifacts through filter design or probabilistic prior modeling, they are often effective only for specific types of artifacts, lacking generalization and adaptability. To address this, we propose a novel image compression artifact removal model: ARMoE, which combines multiple frequency-domain transformations with the MoE (Mixture of Experts). Considering the frequency distribution and energy distribution differences of images, we introduce various frequency-domain transformations as expert branches and use a sparse activation mechanism to adaptively select the optimal frequency-domain expert to suppress compression artifacts, achieving an efficient artifact removal method. Furthermore, we re-encode and decode multiple high-quality datasets, including DF2K and Kodak24, using the VTM-20.0 codec under the VVC standard, constructing a more challenging artifact dataset. We conducted rigorous comparative experiments with current state-of-the-art image restoration methods, and the results demonstrate that ARMoE exhibits outstanding image restoration capability.*

### Run the following script to create VVC-CAR dataset:

- Place the VTM-20.0 codec and ffmpeg files in the same directory as the high-quality image folder.

```shell
# step1: Convert image from png format to yuv format
ffmpeg -i filename.png -s widthxheight -pix_fmt yuv420p filename.yuv

# step2: sing the All-Intra (AI) configuration in VTM-20.0
refer to: https://www.cnblogs.com/ayuanstudy/p/16085134.html

# step3: Execute encoding command
EncoderApp.exe   -c encoder_intra_vtm.cfg > Enc_Out.txt 

# step4: Execute decoding command
DecoderApp.exe   -b str.bin -o dec.yuv

# step5: Convert image from yuv format to png format
ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -s:v widthxheight -pix_fmt yuv420p -i dec.yuv dec.png
```
